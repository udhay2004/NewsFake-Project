Fake News Detection Using Machine Learning
Overview
This project is a Fake News Detection System that classifies news articles as real or fake using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning techniques. The model is trained on textual data and deployed using Gradio for easy interaction.

Features
✅ Detects fake and real news articles based on text input
✅ Uses LSTM-based Deep Learning Model for classification
✅ Implements Gradio UI for user-friendly predictions
✅ Supports pretrained tokenizer for consistent text processing

Technologies Used
Python
TensorFlow / Keras
NLP (Tokenization, Padding)
Pickle (For saving & loading the tokenizer)
Gradio (For creating a user-friendly web interface)
